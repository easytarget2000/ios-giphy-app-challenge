# iOS GIPHY App Challenge
Coding Challenge: A mobile app that shows the currently trending content from GIPHY.

## Build Instructions
The app has been developed in Xcode 10.3 using Swift 5 with a deployment target of iOS 12.0. Run the Photo Challenge target in Xcode on an iPhone or iPad running iOS 12.0 or later.

## Development Approach
I started working on this take home test by separating the task description into small issues. These issues filled up a simple [kanban board](https://github.com/easytargetmixel/ios-giphy-app-challenge/projects/1), along with my initial thoughts and ideas in the issue descriptions. 

As this is a coding challenge, I have not deleted branches after merging them into the release branch (master). This way, it is easier to trace the work that has been done.

## Possible Improvements

During the initial project phase and as I made progress, I identified several additional features and potential improvements. Whenever I have an idea during the development process, I try to turn it into a full-fledged issue. Not only does this ensure that ideas do not get lost, it also acts as a kind of filter. Adding a short issue description and prioritising an issue helps determining the feasibility of a feature. Additional features and potential changes can be found in the [Issues Section](https://github.com/easytargetmixel/ios-giphy-app-challenge/issues).
